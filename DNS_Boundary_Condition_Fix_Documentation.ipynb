    "### The Kim & Moin Fractional Step Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fractional step method for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the Kim & Moin approach uses an intermediate boundary condition for the viscous step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "u*_wall = -Δt (∇p)_wall\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This boundary condition is designed to account for the pressure force that acts on the fluid at the wall during the viscous substep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Error Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "The original implementation **incorrectly applied this boundary condition to ALL velocity components**, including the wall-normal component (w):\n",

    "2. **Step 2**: Incorrect BC creates non-zero intermediate velocity: `w* = -Δt(∂p/∂z)`\n",
    "3. **Step 3**: Pressure solver sees non-zero w* at wall and generates large correction φ to force w back to zero\n",
    "4. **Step 4**: This correction pollutes the total pressure field: `p_new = p_old + φ`\n",
    "5. **Step 5**: Larger pressure gradients in next iteration → Even worse w* → Exponential growth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "w*_n+1 = -Δt (∂p/∂z)_n\n",
    "φ_n+1 = large correction to force w_n+1 = 0\n",

    "Of course. Implementing 2/3 rule dealiasing is the standard and most robust way to eliminate the aliasing instabilities that were causing your code to diverge. It's more memory-efficient than padding the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to use only the lower 2/3 of your available Fourier modes for the calculation. You effectively treat your `128x64` grid as if it were an `85x42` grid, using the extra resolution as a buffer to catch and discard the aliasing errors.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Logic: A Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves transforming your fields, zeroing out the high-frequency modes, performing the multiplication, and then zeroing out the high-frequency modes again.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Transform to Spectral Space:** Begin by taking the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the velocity fields `u`, `v`, and `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Calculate Vorticity Spectrally:** With the velocity in Fourier space, you can calculate the vorticity components much more efficiently. For example, the Fourier coefficients of $\\\\omega\\_z = \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial x} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y}$ are simply:\n",
    "    $$\\hat{\\omega}_z(k_x, k_y) = i k_x \\hat{v}(k_x, k_y) - i k_y \\hat{u}(k_x, k_y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Truncate (The 2/3 Rule):** Before multiplying, you must create \"smooth\" versions of your fields. This is done by zeroing out the upper 1/3 of the wavenumber coefficients for all six fields (`u`, `v`, `w`, `ωx`, `ωy`, `ωz`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Inverse FFT to Physical Space:** Transform these truncated spectral fields back to physical space. The resulting fields are smooth representations of the velocity and vorticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Multiply in Physical Space:** Now, perform the nonlinear cross-product multiplications in physical space (e.g., `su = v_smooth * ωz_smooth - w_smooth * ωy_smooth`). Because the input fields were smoothed, the aliasing errors from this product will fall exclusively into that upper 1/3 of Fourier modes that you initially zeroed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Forward FFT & Final Truncation:** Transform the resulting physical-space products (`su`, `sv`, `sw`) back to spectral space. The aliasing errors will now appear as non-zero values in the upper 1/3 of the modes.
