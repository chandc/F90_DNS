    "### üêõ Critical Bug: Incorrect Helmholtz Matrix Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "The subroutine `solve_viscous_helmholtz` has a bug in the way the linear system for the viscous step is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Issue:** In the Galerkin formulation of the Helmholtz equation, $(I - \\theta \\Delta t \\nu \\nabla^2)u^* = \\text{RHS}$, the diffusion term $\\nabla^2$ leads to a stiffness matrix in the linear system. The scaling factor `factor = theta * dt / re` should multiply the *entire* stiffness matrix. The current code only multiplies the *diagonal elements* of the stiffness matrix by this factor, which is mathematically incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Impact:** This will result in an inaccurate calculation of viscous diffusion, leading to incorrect velocity fields and potentially numerical instability, especially at lower Reynolds numbers or with larger time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Recommendation:** The matrix assembly logic should be refactored. First, build the full stiffness matrix representing the weak form of the negative Laplacian $(- \\nabla^2_z)$, then scale the entire matrix by `factor` before adding the mass matrix terms.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßπ Code Clarity and Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Issue 1: Misleading Variable Names:** The arrays `dphidx_p`, `dphidy_p`, `dphidz_p` are used to store the gradient of the *total pressure* (`p_total`) from the previous step, not the gradient of the pressure correction (`phi`). The code comment correctly identifies this but doesn't fix it. This is highly confusing and can easily lead to bugs during future modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Recommendation:** For clarity and correctness, perform a global search-and-replace to rename these variables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "      * `dphidx_p` ‚Üí `grad_p_prev_x`\n",
    "      * `dphidy_p` ‚Üí `grad_p_prev_y`\n",
    "      * `dphidz_p` ‚Üí `grad_p_prev_z`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Issue 2: Variable Name Shadowing:** In `read_input_3d`, the `iostat` variable for the `open` statement is `nx`, which shadows the global module variable for the grid size. This is poor practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Recommendation:** Use a distinct, local variable name for the I/O status, such as `io_status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Issue 3: Deprecated Subroutines:** The code contains subroutines `apply_constant_pressure_gradient_3d` and `apply_boundary_conditions_to_ustar`, which are correctly marked as deprecated.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Recommendation:** Since their functionality has been integrated elsewhere, these subroutines should be completely removed to clean up the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing the critical bug in the Helmholtz solver and eliminating the performance bottleneck from repeated allocations, the solver's accuracy and speed will be substantially improved. The recommended style changes will further enhance its long-term maintainability."

    "Excellent, it's great to see the solver is stable and producing physically reasonable results. The issue you've pointed out‚Äîthe slow growth of divergence‚Äîis a classic, subtle problem in fractional step methods. Your observation is spot on; while the divergence is small, its growth indicates a slight but persistent numerical inconsistency.\n",

    "The root cause is a mismatch between the discrete mathematical operators used in the different stages of the algorithm. Specifically, the way you compute the divergence (`‚àá ‚ãÖ u*`) for the right-hand-side of the pressure equation is not the exact mathematical \"adjoint\" of the gradient (`-‚àáœÜ`) operator used to correct the velocity. This small inconsistency prevents the projection from being perfect, allowing a tiny amount of divergence to leak through at each step, which then accumulates over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this and push the divergence down to machine precision, you need to implement a **consistent pressure Poisson equation**. This is done by reformulating the right-hand-side of the equation using integration by parts, ensuring the discrete operators are perfectly matched.\n",
